# BlankDweb - Personal Portfolio Website

This is a single-page, static portfolio website for a creative web developer. It is built using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on a premium, modern, and responsive design.

## Preview

It is recommended to view the `index.html` file in a browser to see the complete design and functionality. The site is fully responsive and features animations that are best experienced live.

### Step 4: Access Your Site

GitHub will start a deployment process which may take a minute or two. Once it's complete, your new portfolio website will be live at:

`https://your-username.github.io`

Or, if you used a different repository name:

`https://your-username.github.io/my-portfolio`

That's it! Your luxury portfolio is now live.
