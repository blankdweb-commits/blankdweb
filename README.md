# BlankDweb - Personal Portfolio Website

This is a single-page, static portfolio website for a creative web developer. It is built using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on a premium, modern, and responsive design.

## Preview

It is recommended to view the `index.html` file in a browser to see the complete design and functionality. The site is fully responsive and features animations that are best experienced live.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

Follow these simple steps to deploy this website to your own GitHub account for free.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1.  Log in to your GitHub account.
2.  Create a new repository.
3.  **Important:** Name the repository `your-username.github.io`, where `your-username` is your actual GitHub username. This will create a user page.
    *   Alternatively, you can name it anything else (e.g., `my-portfolio`), but the URL will be slightly different (`your-username.github.io/my-portfolio`).

### Step 2: Upload the Files

1.  Open the repository on your local machine using Git or download the code.
2.  Add the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files to the repository.
3.  Commit and push the changes to the `main` branch.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1.  In your repository on GitHub, go to the **Settings** tab.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
3.  Under "Build and deployment", for the "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
4.  For the "Branch", select `main` and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.
5.  Click **Save**.

### Step 4: Access Your Site

GitHub will start a deployment process which may take a minute or two. Once it's complete, your new portfolio website will be live at:

`https://your-username.github.io`

Or, if you used a different repository name:

`https://your-username.github.io/my-portfolio`

That's it! Your luxury portfolio is now live.
